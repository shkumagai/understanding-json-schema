"Let's start with the simpler case of property dependencies.  For example,"

"If you don't have their credit card number, a billing address would not "
"be required.  We represent this dependency of one property on another "
"using the ``dependencies`` keyword. The value of the ``dependencies`` "

"As we saw above, ``additionalProperties`` can restrict the object so that"
" it either has no additional properties that weren't explicitly listed, "

"Sometimes that isn't enough, and you may want to restrict the names of "
"the extra properties, or you may want to say that, given a particular "
"kind of name, the value should match a particular schema. That's where "
"``patternProperties`` comes in: it is a new keyword that maps from "
"regular expressions to schemas.  If an additional property matches a "
"given regular expression, it must also validate against the corresponding"
" schema."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/reference/object.rst:453
msgid ""
"When defining the regular expressions, it's important to note that the "
"expression may match anywhere within the property name.  For example, the"
" regular expression ``\"p\"`` will match any property name with a ``p`` "
"in it, such as ``\"apple\"``, not just a property whose name is simply "
"``\"p\"``.  It's therefore usually less confusing to surround the regular"
" expression in ``^...$``, for example, ``\"^p$\"``."

"In this example, any additional properties whose names start with the "

"example, based on above, we add a ``\"builtin\"`` property, which must be"
