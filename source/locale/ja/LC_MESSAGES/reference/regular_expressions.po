"The :ref:`pattern <pattern>` and `patternProperties` keywords use regular"
" expressions to express constraints.  The regular expression syntax used "
"is from JavaScript (`ECMA 262 <http://www.ecma-"
"international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm>`__, specifically)."
" However, that complete syntax is not widely supported, therefore it is "
"recommended that you stick to the subset of that syntax described below."
