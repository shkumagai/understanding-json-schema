"JSON Schema includes a few keywords, ``title``, ``description`` and "
"``default``, that aren't strictly used for validation, but are used to "
"describe parts of a schema."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/reference/generic.rst:21
msgid ""
"The ``title`` and ``description`` keywords must be strings.  A \"title\" "
"will preferably be short, whereas a \"description\" will provide a more "
"lengthy explanation about the purpose of the data described by the "
"schema.  Neither are required, but they are encouraged for good practice."

#: ../../source/reference/generic.rst:27
msgid ""
"The ``default`` keyword specifies a default value for an item.  JSON "
"processing tools may use this information to provide a default value for "
"a missing key/value pair, though many JSON schema validators simply "
"ignore the ``default`` keyword.  It should validate against the schema in"
" which it resides, but that isn't required."

"The ``enum`` keyword is used to restrict a value to a fixed set of "
"values.  It must be an array with at least one element, where each "
"element is unique."

"You can use ``enum`` even without a type, to accept values of different "

" also add 42, just for fun."

"This is in the enum, but it's invalid against { \"type\": \"string\" }, "
