"The ``string`` type is used for strings of text.  It may contain Unicode "
"characters."

"The length of a string can be constrained using the ``minLength`` and "
"``maxLength`` keywords.  For both keywords, the value must be a non-"
"negative number."

"The ``pattern`` keyword is used to restrict a string to a particular "
"regular expression.  The regular expression syntax is the one defined in "
"JavaScript (`ECMA 262 <http://www.ecma-"
"international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm>`__ specifically)."
"  See `regular-expressions` for more information."

#: ../../source/reference/string.rst:78
msgid ""
"When defining the regular expressions, it's important to note that the "
"string is considered valid if the expression matches anywhere within the "
"string.  For example, the regular expression ``\"p\"`` will match any "
"string with a ``p`` in it, such as ``\"apple\"`` not just a string that "
"is simply ``\"p\"``.  Therefore, it is usually less confusing, as a "
"matter of course, to surround the regular expression in ``^...$``, for "
"example, ``\"^p$\"``, unless there is a good reason not to do so."

msgid ""
"The ``format`` keyword allows for basic semantic validation on certain "
"kinds of string values that are commonly used.  This allows values to be "
"constrained beyond what the other tools in JSON Schema, including "
"`regular-expressions` can do."

"JSON Schema implementations are not required to implement this part of "
"the specification, and many of them do not."

msgid ""
"There is a bias toward networking-related formats in the JSON Schema "
"specification, most likely due to its heritage in web technologies. "
"However, custom formats may also be used, as long as the parties "
"exchanging the JSON documents also exchange information about the custom "
"format types.  A JSON Schema validator will ignore any format type that "
"it does not understand."
